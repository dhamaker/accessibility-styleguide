# Accessibilty Style Guide
Simple example of an accessibility styleguide leverageing GitHub for collaboration, version control, and hosting of static site.

* [Example site](https://dhamaker.github.io/accessibility-styleguide/) uses stock Slate theme.  Other themes are available, or
* You can create custom themes using [Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  Jeckyll is an open source static site generator.
* The site refreshes automatically when you commit to the master branch. 
* Example is public, but you can control access on you own, or host the site yourself.
* GitHub enables collaboration allowing two contributers to work on the same file at the same time by creating a working draft and then submitting it to the maintainer for review when the are done.
* Contributers can edit using simple markdown (like a Wiki), HTML, or a combination.
* GitHub facilitates documnet governance, letting you limit who can publish to the main branch while allowing anyone on your team to make modifications and updates.
* GitHub provides issues tracking and assignment to help you manage your style guide.
