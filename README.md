# Accessibilty Style Guide
Simple example of an accessibility styleguide leverageing GitHub for collaboration, version control, and hosting of static site.

## A Living Guideline
* [Example site](https://dhamaker.github.io/accessibility-styleguide/) uses stock Slate theme.  Other themes are available, or
* You can  customize and themes the expierence using [Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static site generator.
* The site refreshes automatically when you commit new files to the master branch. 
* It's web content, soe you can include live examples and links to other resources.
* While is a public GitHub example, you can control access.  Or, use Jekyll to host the site yourself.

## A Design Governance Framework
* GitHub is a collaboration platform. Multiple contributers can work on the same file at the same time by simply creating a local  working branch. When they are done they submit their changes to the maintainer for review using a pull request.  The maintainer can review the proposed changes, compare them to the source, resolve any issues, and commit the changes for publication.
* Contributers can edit using simple markdown (like a Wiki), HTML, or a combination.
* GitHub facilitates document governance, letting you limit who can publish to the main branch while allowing anyone on your team to make modifications and updates.
* GitHub provides issues tracking and assignment to help you manage your style guide.


## Sample Site Map 
A two level hierarchy based on users mental model.  Your team may need more than one index.  Jekyll supports supports tags and cateogy facets for more ad hoc organization.  These can be used to organize patterns for differnet audiences or activities.

2. Navigation Category
    1. [Pattern Detail - Breadcrumb](breadcrumb)
    2. [Pattern Detail - Template](template-pattern-detail)
