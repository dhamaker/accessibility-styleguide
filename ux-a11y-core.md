# UX A11Y Core Guidelines
In the public business, everyone is responsible for equal access. Web Accessibility focuses on stories and use cases that include people with cognitive, visual, auditory, speech, physical, or neurological impairments.   It also targets people without disabilities including emerging tech, people with changing abilities, temporary disabilities (like a broken hand), environmental conditions (like bright sunlight), and people on slow or expensive bandwidth.

When we are successful, our design benefits everyone: like yellow curb cuts.

## Who job is it?
It’s everyone's.  Product Managers, Analysts, Writers, Designers, Developers, Researchers, Customer Service. Accessibility touches every activity digital product development activity planning, analysis, architecture, design, writing, engineering, development, quality assurance, and support.

## Core Principles

### KISS
>  Create patterns for the newbies you will train.

Use the simplest markup necessary to make products accessible, robust, and affordable.  Go ahead and extend HTML and create custom elements,  when there is a business case.  Remember, you may be the one to explain how to implement them.  Make today's design simple so you can spend tomorrow building for the future.  

### Web Standards
> HTML is the medium of Web.

HTML is accessible out-of-the-box.  It was planned that way and it  has broad support and robust features.  Web Standards, like HTML, provide tools and guidance to make our content and design interoperable, scalable, and robust.  Remember, the first Web page published in 1991 still works every modern user agent and device.  How long will your site live?

### Responsive Design and Progressive Enhancement
> Content is born words and the rest is HTML.

Words are the stuff of the Web.  Web design enhances the word and makes it understandable, perceivable, operable, and robust for the Web.

Responsive design is the activity of making content that adapts to different technologies so that the simple word can become a rich experience that engages everyone, everywhere, any time, and on any device.  Adaptation includes changes in devices, display sizes, and screen resolutions; as well as screen readers, braille readers, voice, magnifier, mouse, keyboard, touch pad, touch screen, bandwidth, and more.  It includes the  parts as well as the page.

By designing with assistive technologies in mind, we create more adaptable  experiences for everyone.  And we ensure that today’s words will reach tomorrow’s technologies.


## Core Techniques

### Consistency
> Repetition is good for the mind.

Consistency makes learning easy, so our users can do things more quickly and with greater success.   Things that look the same should  behave the same; those that behave the same should look the same. Without consistency there are no patterns.

### Multiple Ways
> Everyone has a mix of learning styles.

We are all learn differently.  Some learn by reading, others by observing, and others by doing. We also use the web differently.  When designing for the public, design for multiple ways.  Consider Browsing, menus, and search. Articles and video.  Mouse and keyboard.  Scanning and deep reading.  

### Info and Relationships
> Chaos is the formless matter that existed before creation.

Nouns, verbs, and other grammatical structures are essential to communicating in person.  HTML is the grammar of the Web; headings, lists, paragraphs and other semantic markup communicate content to humans and machines.  Without these rich semantics, Web sites become unintelligible run-ons.  Providing structure and makes Web sites more usable, easier to find, and easier to manage. Without semantic structure there is no Web.

Good design needs good content and structure.

### Contrast
> The five colors blind the eye.

Contrast is an essential design principle.  The Socratic method is based on contrast of ideas.  Music relies on the contrast of sound and silence.  Contrast provides meaning.

We use contrast to clarify information and relationships. We use contrast to create choice.  We use it to influence emotions, to emphasize actions and paths, and to create meaning.  We have tests for color and audio contrast between words and background. But, we also need to ensure contrast between content and content parts.
