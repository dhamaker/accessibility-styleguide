## General Principles
* __Design for Web Standards__ - HTML is Accessible. Don't break it. Native HTML elements have semantic roles and attributes that support accessibility with basic HTML knowledge.
* __Design for progressive enhancement__.  Look at basic HTML first.  Next, Enhance the  basic elements for your experience.  Finally, carefully evaluate custom component as a last resort.
* __Responsive Use__ - One document. Multiple presentations, multiple devices.  This means presntation to desktop, mobile, tablet, screen reader, and braile; plus print, screen, audio; humans and machines crawlers and screenscrappers.
* __Use Accessible Tools__ Use Know the capabilities of your authoring tools.  Use libraries and applications that are built for Accessibility.  Some tools will generate accessible content with no extra work on your part.  Other's will never generate accessible content.  And, others will only do so with custom development.
